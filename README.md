# template-for-extensions
Easy to use template for creating extensions for interactions.py!

Hello there!

This is a template for creating an extension for interactions.py.
Fork or clone this and start coding right away!
You may change this `README.md` to stuff about your soon-to-be package!
This file will automatically be used to provide a description for PyPI.

## PyPI Section:

IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS WORK:
- In PyPI:
    - Go to https://pypi.org/ and log in
    - Go to the "Account settings" tab
    - Scroll down till you reach "API tokens"
    - Add a new API token with your project name as the token name
    - Choose "Entire account (all projects)" scope
        - This is done since the project still is not created
            - The action will create it automatically
    - Click "Add token" and save it somewhere safe
- In GitHub repository:
    - Go to the "Settings" tab
    - Next, go to the "Secrets" side tab
    - Click "New repository secret"
    - (IMPORTANT) Set name to "PYPI_API_TOKEN"
    - Set value to your API token you got earlier
    - Click "Add secret"

What to do:
- Change file/directory name `import_name` with the package import name
- Add your code inside `import_name/` directory
- Add dependencies separated by newlines in `requirements.txt`
- Modify `setup.py` to your needs
- Optional:
    - Add ignored files/directories in `.gitignore`
    - Change license

How to make new PyPI releases?
- (IMPORTANT) Increment version in `setup.py`
- Make a new release in GitHub with same tag as version
- The action will automatically publish a new PyPI release for you!

## Extension Section:

This is a raw template that will get you started coding an extension.

I have put comments in the code to help you understand what to do.

You may need to rename some file and directory names to fit your needs.
